     # Day 5: Cafeteria
     ## Part 1: Count Fresh Ingredients
     ### Problem Understanding
     The Elves have a database that shows which ingredient IDs are fresh
     and which are spoiled. The database contains:
     1. A list of fresh ingredient ID ranges (inclusive)
     2. A blank line separator
     3. A list of available ingredient IDs

● Now I understand Part 2. Instead of checking which available IDs are fresh, we need to count ALL ingredient IDs that the ranges consider to be fresh. Let me update the README and write the solution.

      62 +### Problem Understanding                                      
      63 +Now we need to ignore the second section (available ingredient 
         + IDs) completely. Instead, we need to count ALL ingredient IDs 
         + that the fresh ranges consider to be fresh.                   
      64 +

      71 +

      76 +- Range 12-18 covers: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (7 IDs)       
      77 +- But ranges overlap! Unique IDs: 14 total                     
      78 +                                                               
      79 +Answer: 14 ingredient IDs

      81 +### Strategy                                                   
      82 +Since ranges can be very large (millions of IDs), we can't     
         +iterate through all IDs. We need to:                           
      83 +1. Parse all ranges                                            
      84 +2. Merge overlapping and adjacent ranges                       
      85 +3. Sum up the sizes of merged ranges                           
      86 +                                                               
      87 +### Merging Algorithm                                          
      88 +1. Sort ranges by start position                               
      89 +2. Iterate through sorted ranges                               
      90 +3. If current range overlaps or is adjacent to previous, merge 
         + them                                                          
      91 +4. Otherwise, start a new merged range                         
      92 +5. Count total IDs in all merged ranges                        
      93 +
