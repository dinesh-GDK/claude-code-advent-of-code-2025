● I'll help you solve Advent of Code 2025 Day 7! Let me start by creating a todo list and following the instructions.

● Bash(mkdir day_07)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1

● Good! I can see Day 7: Laboratories. The puzzle is about tachyon beams splitting in a manifold. Now let me get the puzzle input.

  ⎿  143

● Perfect! The input has been copied. Now let me understand the problem and write the strategy.

     # Day 7: Laboratories
     ## Part 1
     ### Problem Understanding
     - We have a tachyon manifold represented as a grid
     - A tachyon beam starts at position 'S' and moves **downward**
     - The beam passes through empty space ('.')
     - When a beam encounters a splitter ('^'):
       - The current beam stops

● Write(day_07\part1.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to day_07\part1.py

     def solve(grid):
         """
         Simulate tachyon beam splitting through the manifold.
         Rules:
         - Beams start at 'S' and move downward
         - Beams pass through '.' (empty space)
         - When a beam hits '^' (splitter), it stops and creates two new 
     beams

● Now let me verify with the example from the puzzle (which should give 21 splits):

● Write(day_07\test_example.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to day_07\test_example.py
     from part1 import solve

         ".......^.......",
         "...............",
         "......^.^......",
         "...............",

● Bash(python day_07/test_example.py)
  ⎿  Example result: 21
     Expected: 21
     Match: True

● Perfect! The solution works correctly on the example. Now let me run it on the puzzle input:

● Perfect! Now I understand Part 2. The example shows that the particle ends up on 40 different timelines.

  The key difference from Part 1:
  - In Part 1, we counted the number of split events (1628)
  - In Part 2, we count the number of distinct timelines (paths) through the manifold

  Each time the quantum particle hits a splitter, the timeline splits - the particle takes BOTH paths simultaneously in different timelines. We need to count how many distinct timelines exist after all possibilities are exhausted.

  Let me update the README and write the solution:

      35  ### Example                                                    
      36  In the given example, the beam is split 21 times total as it   
          propagates through the manifold structure.

      42 +### Problem Understanding                                      
      43 +- The manifold is actually a **quantum tachyon manifold**      
      44 +- Only a **single tachyon particle** is sent through the       
         +manifold                                                       
      45 +- The particle takes **both the left and right path** at each  
         +splitter encountered                                           
      46 +- Uses the **many-worlds interpretation**: when a particle     
         +reaches a splitter, **time itself splits**                     
      47 +  - In one timeline, the particle went left                    
      48 +  - In the other timeline, the particle went right             
      49 +- We need to count the **total number of different timelines** 
         + that exist after the single particle completes all possible   
         +journeys through the manifold                                  
      50 +                                                               
      51 +### Strategy                                                   
      52 +1. Use recursion with memoization to count all possible paths  
         +(timelines) through the manifold                               
      53 +2. For each position (r, c):                                   
      54 +   - If out of bounds: return 1 (this is one timeline that     
         +exited)                                                        
      55 +   - If at a splitter ('^'): return count_paths(r, c-1) +      
         +count_paths(r, c+1)                                            
      56 +   - If at empty space ('.' or 'S'): return count_paths(r+1,   
         +c)                                                             
      57 +3. Start from the 'S' position and count all possible paths    
      58 +                                                               
      59 +### Key Insights                                               
      60 +- Unlike Part 1, we DON'T merge beams at the same position     
      61 +- Each unique path through the manifold represents a distinct  
         +timeline                                                       
      62 +- Even if two paths end at the same position, they are         
         +different timelines if they took different routes              
      63 +- The answer is the sum of all paths that exit the manifold    
      64 +- This is a tree-counting problem where each splitter creates  
         +a branch point                                                 
      65 +                                                               
      66 +### Example                                                    
      67 +In the given example, the particle ends up on 40 different     
         +timelines.

  Part 1: Classical Tachyon Manifold

  - Problem: Count the number of times beams are split as they propagate through the manifold
  - Solution: BFS simulation tracking beam positions and counting split events
  - Answer: 1628 ✓

  Part 2: Quantum Tachyon Manifold

  - Problem: Count the number of different timelines created by a single quantum particle taking all possible paths
  - Solution: Recursive memoization to count all distinct paths through the manifold
  - Answer: 27055852018812 ✓

  The key insight for Part 2 was recognizing that in the quantum version, we're counting paths (timelines) rather than split events. Each splitter creates a branch point where the timeline splits, and we count the total number of distinct paths that exit the manifold.
